INSTRUCTIONS FOR TESTING YOUR CIRCUIT

We provide a test bench (keypad.v) that provides mostly tests your code, you do 
not need to modify it unless you want to explore. You will need to modify keypad.v. 
You can compile your code with the provided test bench with the following command:

     iverilog -Wall -o keypad keypad.v keypad_tb.v

which will generate an executable called 'keypad' which can then be executed
by the following command:

     ./keypad

Running the executable will create a printout to the terminal that essentially draws 
a truth table of what your circuit actually implemented
